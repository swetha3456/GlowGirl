As a girl aiming to boost strength and overall fitness, specific strategies cater to women's unique needs. Incorporating resistance training exercises like squats, lunges, and push-ups gradually with progressive overload techniques ensures continual progress. Cardiovascular exercises like running, cycling, or dancing enhance cardiovascular health and calorie burning.

Throughout the menstrual cycle, hormonal fluctuations can impact energy levels and exercise performance. During the follicular phase (days 1-14), focusing on balanced nutrition with a mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats supports energy levels for workouts. As estrogen levels rise, strength and endurance may increase, making it an ideal time for intense workouts. During the luteal phase (days 15-28), when progesterone levels rise, incorporating nutrient-dense foods rich in iron and magnesium can help combat fatigue and support muscle recovery. Tailoring workouts to include lower-intensity activities like yoga or swimming during this phase can help manage symptoms like bloating and fatigue.
